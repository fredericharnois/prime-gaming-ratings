# Prime Gaming Ratings Chrome Extension

## Overview

This Chrome extension enhances your Amazon Prime Gaming experience by displaying game ratings directly on the Prime Gaming website. It fetches and displays ratings from the IGDB (Internet Games Database) for each game available on Prime Gaming, helping users make informed decisions about which games to claim and play.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies game titles on the Prime Gaming website and fetches their corresponding ratings from IGDB.
- **Rating Display**: Shows the IGDB rating prominently next to each game title on the Prime Gaming page.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Seamlessly integrates with the existing Prime Gaming layout for a native feel.

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download**: Clone this repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. **Open Chrome Extensions**: Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. **Enable Developer Mode**: Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top right corner.
4. **Load Unpacked Extension**: Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files.

## Configuration

Before using the extension, you need to set up an API proxy to access IGDB data:

1. **Set Up IGDB Proxy**: Due to CORS restrictions, a server-side proxy is required to fetch data from IGDB. The provided `igdbproxy.js` script is designed to be deployed as a Cloudflare Worker.
2. **Obtain IGDB API Credentials**: Sign up on [IGDB](https://api.igdb.com/) to get your API credentials.
3. **Deploy the Cloudflare Worker**:
   - Log into your [Cloudflare Workers dashboard](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).
   - Create a new Worker and replace the default script with the contents of `igdbproxy.js`.
   - Deploy the Worker and copy the provided URL.
4. **Update Extension Configuration**: Modify the `background.js` file in the extension to point to your Cloudflare Worker URL.

## Usage

1. **Navigate to Prime Gaming**: Go to the [Prime Gaming website](https://gaming.amazon.com/).
2. **View Game Ratings**: As you browse available games, the extension will display IGDB ratings next to each game's title.
